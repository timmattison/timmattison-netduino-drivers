NOTE: This driver is for C328/OV764x with OV528 chips only!  The C329 cameras
        are (supposedly) completely different and are definitely untested.  Do
        not try to use this library with anything but a C328/OV328 camera.  The
        model that I used was Sparkfun's JPEG color camera - UART interface
        (SEN-09334).

This driver is for cameras using the OV328 chip.  This chip isn't known for its
reliability, actually quite the opposite, but it is definitely an inexpensive
option if you're looking to play around with an RS-232 camera that spits out
JPEGs.

Despite its shortcomings its actually a decent platform to start learning about
serial protocols.  The protocol is fairly simple but includes enough behind the
scenes work for the programmer to make it interesting without becoming onerous.

To be perfectly honest here are the list of shortcomings that I know of:
  - Sometimes the camera will fail to initialize or "sync"
  - Sometimes the camera will stop sending data in the middle of a picture
  - Sometimes either of the previous two situations can only be remedied by
      power cycling the camera

These flaws have been corroborated by a few other places on the Internet so I
know that it's not just me.  Some places that mention this chip and its quirks
are:
  - DIY Drones - "Secrets of the C328" - http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/secrets-of-the-c328
  - Hag's House - "C328 Serial Camera" - http://www.hagshouse.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=38355

This library was implemented in a 100% clean room environment.  All the code
was developed and tested by me as I only recently found these pages where
others had written their own libraries and it turns out that a lot of the links
are now dead.
