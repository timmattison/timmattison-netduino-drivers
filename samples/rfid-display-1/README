If you want to run this sample without any modifications you'll need the
following:

- A Netduino (I have tested this on the Netduino Plus)
- A Sparkfun serial LCD (SKU LCD-00709 or comparable)
- A Parallax RFID reader (Parallax item code 28140)

Now wire up the data path:
  - The RFID reader's SOUT line connects to the Netduino's D0
  - The serial LCD's yellow wire connects to the Netduino's D3
  - The RFID reader's /ENABLE line connects to the Netduino's D4

It is up to you to wire the power for this circuit properly.  If you don't
feel comforable doing this then you should ask someone!

After that you can load this project in Visual Studio and deploy it to your
device.  Good luck!
