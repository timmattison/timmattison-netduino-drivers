This project contains drivers for various hardware components that I've used.
It also contains some sample code to make use of the drivers

The supported devices are:
  - drivers/rfid-reader-parallax-28140   - Parallax RS-232 RFID reader (Parallax item code 28140)
  - drivers/character-lcd-sparkfun-00709 - Sparkfun's 16x2 LCD which also works with 1, 2, 3, and
      4 line displays in either 16 or 20 character widths (Sparkfun SKU LCD-00709)
  - drivers/chainable-rgbled-grove - Grove's chainable RGB LED.  This supports chaining as many
      RGB LEDs together as you'd like and uses their own protocol to pass data from one device to
      another.  A good piece of hardware to pick up if you just want to play around with LEDs.
      (Seeed SKU COM53140P)

The sample projects are:
  - samples/rfid-display-1 - Uses rfid-reader-parallax-28140 and character-lcd-sparkfun-00709 to
      display RFID tag ID's on a character based LCD as they are scanned.  A video of this project
      in action is here: http://youtu.be/7h-9A0ChoNU
  - samples/triple-rgb-led-1 - Uses three Grove chainable RGB LEDs and flashes random colors.  A
      video of this project in action is here: http://youtu.be/cOlJoXWr_qQ
  - samples/triple-rgb-led-2 - Uses three Grove chainable RGB LEDs and cycles the first from off
      to solid red, the second from off to solid green, the third from off to solid blue, and then
      repeats.  A video of this project in action is here: http://youtu.be/b5X3mvLbBf8
