This project contains drivers for various hardware components that I've used.
It also contains some sample code to make use of the drivers

The supported devices are:
  - drivers/rfid-reader-parallax-28140   - Parallax RS-232 RFID reader (Parallax item code 28140)
  - drivers/character-lcd-sparkfun-00709 - Sparkfun's 16x2 LCD which also works with 1, 2, 3, and
      4 line displays in either 16 or 20 character widths (Sparkfun SKU LCD-00709)

The sample projects are:
  - samples/rfid-display-1 - Uses rfid-reader-parallax-28140 and character-lcd-sparkfun-00709 to
      display RFID tag ID's on a character based LCD as they are scanned
